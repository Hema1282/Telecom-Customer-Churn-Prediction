# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
## Project Overview:
In today's competitive telecom industry, retaining customers is more important than ever. Customer churn, or when users leave for another provider, can significantly impact a company's bottom line. This project focuses on building a predictive model to help identify which customers are likely to leave based on their usage patterns, behavior, and other factors. By understanding these patterns, companies can act early to keep customers happy and reduce churn.

## Problem Statement:
In the dynamic landscape of the telecommunications industry, customers wield the power to choose from a plethora of service providers for their communication and internet needs. Customer satisfaction plays a pivotal role as users often form opinions about an entire company based on a single interaction. 
Churn rate, a key metric representing the number of customers who terminate or do not renew their subscriptions, directly impacts revenue. Given the high costs associated with acquiring new customers, an in-depth churn analysis is imperative. Insights derived from this analysis empower companies to formulate strategic approaches, target specific segments, enhance service quality, and ultimately foster trust with their customers. Building predictive models and generating comprehensive reports through churn analysis thus becomes instrumental in driving sustainable growth.
